    Your experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages.
GitHub has been a, sort of, Achilles Heel of mine in the past of intergrating with working digitally, but with the experience thet I managed to garner from my past year of working with GitHub, it created an experience that was that was close to smooth-sailing. The process began with us having to a new index.html within a file that would then be published in the GitHub. The process the required us to make our GitHub repositories public and then link it to a main branch which would enable us to make changes to our index.html and push them to our GitHub. This process then led us to the final process which was to publish our GitHub page that would give us access to our website. Navigating this process was made easy by the guidance that the slides gave us with regards to setting up our repositories. Not only did this just help us set up our repositories, but it also ensured that we are able to properly create a GitHub for future index.html pages that we will be creating in the future.
