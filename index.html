    Your experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages.
GitHub has been a, sort of, Achilles Heel of mine in the past of intergrating with working digitally, but with the experience thet I managed to garner from my past year of working with GitHub, it created an experience that was that was close to smooth-sailing. The process began with us having to a new index.html within a file that would then be published in the GitHub. The process the required us to make our GitHub repositories public and then link it to a main branch which would enable us to make changes to our index.html and push them to our GitHub. This process then led us to the final process which was to publish our GitHub page that would give us access to our website. Navigating this process was made easy by the guidance that the slides gave us with regards to setting up our repositories. Not only did this just help us set up our repositories, but it also ensured that we are able to properly create a GitHub for future index.html pages that we will be creating in the future.
    Reflection on the readings you selected - relating it to your experience with the internet today
The reading that I selected for this week's blog post is Simon Harper's 'As We May Think' at 65. 'As We May Think' at 65 is based on the a paper titled 'As We May Think' by Vannevar Bush and Harper reflects on the impact of the reading 65 years after its initial release and how it is still relevant in the world of the internet today. Vannevar Bush is known as a pioneer in the hypertext field and Harper reflects on one of his works, MEMEX which he describes as an analogue information system that is still very much a mainstay and impactful system to hypertext and also to the World Wide Web (WWW). Harprrt highlights some of Bush's works and how they were impactful to the hypertext industry and he describes the Differential Analyser, a 1927 computer system that, to describe in short terms, has the ability to silve differential equations. The device, in a way, displayed Bush's understanding of the real world and just how much the real world required humans to utilize and understand various complexities and how to make associations that link to one another for things to actually make sense. To elaborate futher, Harper critically analyses the the process of association and the human mind and how one links things in order to form a complex understanding of the real world. We further understand that Bush was more concerned with working with analogue rather than delving into the digital technologies to whuich we then later understand the intent behind the MEMEX as a device where one could store information such as books and records with the intent of receiving efficient feedback the MEMEX. Harper further sites that the MEMEX seerved as an inspiration to the World Wide Web that we know today, and just based on how we are able to receive information at a quick and effiecient time on today's World Wide Web. Harper also highlights to us the aim behind the MEMEX was not just to test its technocal abilities but rather to make a devive that was capable in the assisting of the humans. "The computer should adapt itself to suit the needs of humans, not in reverse." (Harper, 2010:2). Bush is also quoted in the reading as he describes the process of association in the human brain and how humans have the tendancy of associating things to each other during their thought processes which ultimately results in a web of thoughts that are linked to one another. Bush basically emphasizes the importance of linking information via association rather than via homogeneous hierarchies, which are known as similar modules and ideas that are linked together to form a hierarchy. He further elabortes that humans do not operate via the properties that information contains but rather via the experience that information. Websites contains loads of information which are then placed in specific hierarchies such as webpages and lists that are easily attainable on the Web, but Harper elaborates on the fact that these lack the concept of association, which is where he backs Hypermedia and describes it to be something that enables the personalization of what we are looking for and therefore further enhances our experience of gathering information to one that is more personalized and therefore understandable. 'As We May Think' breaks down to us just how our experience of gathering information can be made easier via asssociation and this results in the making of gathering information much more understandable and therfore expands our thought processes, knowledge and our overall abilities to grasp any information that we would like to learn. This is actually such an insightful reading especially with how the internet works today with the interests of catering to the interests of the users. The internet is able to associate information for us to the extent that we are able to receive information based off of what we consume on the daily on the internet. Think of the idea of algorithms, where the internet and social media is able to associate pieces information according the the things that we are interested in and most likely to search for. Apart from that alone, when you search for something on the internet, you are most likely to learn more than what you had initially intended to, just based off of the fact that we can receive access to more information and insight on the initial idea that you had intended to search for. A nice example is when one searches up football games, not only does one receive the football games from the past and also upcoming football fixtures, but also receives pages such as blogs about these games, information about the players involved in the games and even the insight on the players' conditions and quotes before the game. I didn't seach for those specifics, but the are the ideas and concepts that are associated to the terms that I had intially searched for. In conclusion, the reading makes complete understanding of the process of association and how this concept is one that is there with the intent of making one gather information and learning new things much easier.
