    <h3>List and Explanation of Selected Interface Elements</h3>
</div>
    
<P>
For my Navigation Bar Icons, I decided to continue the theme of using simple logos which will symbolize the different sections of my website.
These icons will be on the left hand side of the page and will end up changing its colour from black to white whenever someone is in a specific
section of the website, e.g. if you in the home section of the website the home icon will turn white, displaying that it is the active page on
the website that you are exploring. 
</P>

<div class="heading">
    <h3>Updated List and Explanation of Selected Interface Elements</h3>
</div>

<P>
   The process of making a navigation bar that would be positioned on the side of my website did not fit the aesthetic that I was aiming for with this
   website, and especially since the theme or concept of my website is simplicity. This nav bar needed a change, and so I decided to revert back to a 
   nav bar that would be on the right margin of the website and then, have my logo positioned on the left margin of my navigation bar. This meant getting
   rid of the idea of using icons for my website and rather, just having the word that represents each website. Then, when you visit the page on the website,
   you will have a large, banner like image that represents what that part of the website will be about, for example, when you enter the Blogs section of 
   the website, this will be represented by a picture that shows someone typing on a laptop or a computer, as this is the procedure taken when a blog is created. 
</P>

<article class="Icons">

    <h3>Icons</h3>
</div>

<P>
This wireframe displays the approach that I was going for with regards to the simplicity of the icons. They are simple, base icons but represent
the idea of the section of the website that you are about to enter.
</P>
<div class="blog-item">

            <h3>House Icon</h3>
        </div>
        
        <P>
            The house icon that will appear right at the top of the list of pages you can visit represents the home page of my website, which is where you
            will find the main information about my website and a slight description of each section of the website and what to expect. The home page will
            be represented by the house logo and will be the main page on which the index of the website will be provided. The choice behind this icon was
            to demonstrate the main home page with a familiar icon that people know to be an indicator of the home page. The home icon is a familiar sight
            for website users, and upon looking at this icon, users will immediately understand what the function of that part of the website is and the
            part of the website that this icon represents. 
        </P>

<div class="blog-item">

            <h3>
                Keyboard and Mouse Icon
            </h3>
        </div>
        
        <P>
            There are easily a lot of icons that I could have selected for this section, but I believe that the keyboard and mouse is an indicator of an
            interaction with a computer and this is what would represent my blogs section. The selected keyboard and mouse icon works well with the concept
            and process of blogging as it takes place on an online platform where written content is published. The keyboard is the writing tool that is used
            to form or type a blog. Like the previous icon, when the icon is displayed in black, this symbolizes the blog section is currently active and the
            page that is being explored.  
        </P>
    </div>
</div>


<div class="blog-item">

        <div class="heading">
            <h3>Profile Icon</h3>
        </div>
        
        <P>
            The profile icon is known for its simple interpretation of a person’s portrait being represented by semi-circle as the upper body and a circle
            represents the head of the figure. This icon is what represents a profile picture and there was no other choice to make other than this icon.
            But the choice that I was faced with was whether to have an icon that was just outlines or to have an icon that was filled. The filled icon
            worked better as it suited the approach that I was going for with regards to the icon being black when selected and then being white when it
            is not selected. The filled profile icon would immediately give the user the idea that this part of the website is about someone and based off
            the information that I plan to give on my home page regarding this part of the website, the user will understand to engage with this icon to
            receive access to my personal profile and information that it has too. 
        </P>

<div class="blog-item">

            <h3>File/Folder Icon</h3>
        </div>
        
        <P>
            The file/folder icon is meant to represent the Portfolio section of my website where users get to explore files of my work and get to see how I
            have worked on any recent projects. The File Icon is one that is quick to recognize, with it being a universally recognized symbol that represents
            documents and any projects that you have worked on. With this icon, users can already understand the function behind this and immediately understand
            that this is the section on the website where you can find my documents and view or even download them. The clearness that the icon provides to the
            user, which is, when I click on this, I will be taken to viewable files, documents, etc., this creates an interaction with more intention and intuition
            for users where they select the icon specifically for the fact that they know what it represents, and this is what they are looking for. 
        </P>

            <h3>Pen and Paper Icon</h3>
        </div>
        
        <P>
            The Pen and Paper Icon is meant to symbolize the writing section of my website. For most websites, this could also symbolize a part of the website where
            one can edit and journal, but for the context of my website, this icon is meant to show that this is the part where all my story writing work and story
            building is found. I would also like for this part to contain any essays that I have written over the year and years to come, to showcase my growth in
            essay writing and to highlight writing as a skill of mine. This icon is also a signifier of creative work and the creative work that I would like to be
            on display here is the any story drafts, plannings, sketches, beat maps, etc. This is the part of the website where the ideas for my writings come to life
            and is a showcase of my process and the pen and paper icon symbolizes the process of creativity with regards to my writing.

            <h3>Paint and Palette Icon</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            The paint icon is a representation of creativity as well, but instead of written creativity, this is a symbol that represents the design/art side of my
            website. This will be the holder of any designs that I make for this website and any future websites that will design. This will be a section of the website
            that will be mainly containing images of design ideas that I have came up with and display the inspirations behind these choices. This part will not only use
            pictures to document my creative process but also use writing and documentation detailing my style choices and why they work. This icon is an indicator of art,
            design and creativity and I immediately want users to see that this part of the website is related to design and art before they even click on it. This is a
            visual cue for website users and a familiar visual cue that users normally engage with upon visiting other websites.

</div>

<P>
    The Arimo font is the one that I decided to go for as the font which my name would be in at the top of the website where my logo will be displayed next to it.
    The Arimo font is a sans-serif font that is found in the Google fonts library. The font takes on a very clean approach and keeps with the theme of simple, but
    effective that I aim to convey with my website. 
</P>

<P>
    The reason why I went for this font specifically for my name on the website is because it is a font with high readability and is also legible. This legibility
    is evident on screens. My whole idea was that since my name is one of the focal points of this website, I want it to have a readability and with use of the Arimo
    font, the name will be easy to read regardless of where and how you see it, and this is based on how clean and simple the letters look in this font. The Arimo font
    is also very versatile with the opportunity to distinct whether you want to use a bold or light version of the font and for the logo, the bold font works perfectly
    as the logo should be the factor with personality on the website and should encapsulate what it is meant to represent.

    </div>
    
    <P>
        The font that I went with for the headings and important subheadings in my website is the Abril Fatface font. The Abril Fatface font is part of the Didone style and
        can also be found in the Google fonts library. I mainly chose this font for the elegance that it holds and for such a website where I chose simple colours and layout,
        I think that the combination of simple elements with a touch of elegant elements could create a very classy user experience and that is the way that I want my website
        to feel, classy! 
    </P>
    
    <P>
        The strong visual impact of this font stems from the use of thick and thin lines in the letters and the combination of these based on the size contrasts within each
        letter is very striking to the eye and can catch the attention of users, especially sighting something important. This font can immediately catch the eye in any design.
        I believe that this font also demands the attention of users without taking up the attention from the rest of the text or elements in your design. The luxury elements
        that this font brings would be similar to a font that is used for fashion and aesthetic purposes, so this font has the luxury aesthetic, and this is what my website to
        be and stand for, luxury.

        <h3>Primary Colour: Russet (#784625)</h3>
    </div>
    <P>
        This colour is chosen as my primary colour as it is a very earthly colour where there is a sense of red and brown tones that work together to create this specific colour.
        When I first saw this colour, it tied to nature due to the brown colour that it had and the mood of autumn time, which makes the website feel warm upon visit. This colour
        also has a vintage feel to it, and it made perfect sense to have this as the primary colour of my website.

        <h3>Secondary Colour: Seasalt (#F7F7F7)</h3>

    <P>
        Seasalt is a variation of the colour white, and white is representation of simplicity and pureness. But this variation could be associated to calm and peace as the sea
        colour and the light tones of green in this colour symbolize nature and the ocean. The background colours should offer peace and relaxation for the users.
