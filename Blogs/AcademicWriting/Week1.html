    <h3>Your experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages</h3>
</div>

<P>
    GitHub has been a sort of, Achilles Heel of mine in the past of integrating with working digitally, but with the
    experience that I managed to garner from my past year of working with GitHub, it created an experience that was that 
    was close to smooth sailing. The process began with us having to a new index.html within a file that would then be published 
    in the GitHub. The process the required us to make our GitHub repositories public and then link it to a main branch which would 
    enable us to make changes to our index.html and push them to our GitHub. This process then led us to the final process which was 
    to publish our GitHub page that would give us access to our website. Navigating this process was made easy by the guidance that the 
    slides gave us with regards to setting up our repositories. Not only did this just help us set up our repositories, but it also ensured 
    that we are able to properly create a GitHub for future index.html pages that we will be creating in the future.

    <h3>Reflection on the readings you selected - relating it to your experience with the internet today</h3>
  </div>
    
   <P>
    The reading that I selected for this week's blog post is Simon Harper's 'As We May Think' at 65. 'As We May Think' at 65 is
    based on a paper titled 'As We May Think' by Vannevar Bush and Harper reflects on the impact of the reading 65 years after its 
    initial release and how it is still relevant in the world of the internet today. Vannevar Bush is known as a pioneer in the hypertext 
    field and Harper reflects on one of his works, MEMEX which he describes as an analogue information system that is still very much a 
    mainstay and impactful system to hypertext and also to the World Wide Web (WWW). Harper highlights some of Bush's works and how they 
    were impactful to the hypertext industry, and he describes the Differential Analyser, a 1927 computer system that, to describe in short 
    terms, has the ability to solve differential equations. 
   </P>
 
 <P>
    The device, in a way, displayed Bush's understanding of the real world and just 
    how much the real world required humans to utilize and understand various complexities and how to make associations that link to one 
    another for things to actually make sense. To elaborate further, Harper critically analyses the process of association and the human 
    mind and how one links things in order to form a complex understanding of the real world. We further understand that Bush was more 
    concerned with working with analogue rather than delving into the digital technologies to which we then later understand the intent 
    behind the MEMEX as a device where one could store information such as books and records with the intent of receiving efficient feedback
    the MEMEX. Harper further sites that the MEMEX served as an inspiration to the World Wide Web that we know today and just based on how
    we are able to receive information at a quick and efficient time on today's World Wide Web. 
 </P>
   

    <P>
        Harper also highlights to us the aim behind
        the MEMEX was not just to test its technical abilities but rather to make a device that was capable in the assisting of the humans.
        "The computer should adapt itself to suit the needs of humans, not in reverse." (Harper, 2010:2). Bush is also quoted in the reading
          as he describes the process of association in the human brain and how humans have the tendency of associating things to each other 
          during their thought processes which ultimately results in a web of thoughts that are linked to one another. Bush basically 
          emphasizes the importance of linking information via association rather than via homogeneous hierarchies, which are known as 
          similar modules and ideas that are linked together to form a hierarchy. He further elaborates that humans do not operate via 
          the properties that information contains but rather via the experience that information. Websites contains loads of information 
          which are then placed in specific hierarchies such as webpages and lists that are easily attainable on the Web, but Harper 
          elaborates on the fact that these lack the concept of association, which is where he backs Hypermedia and describes it to be
           something that enables the personalization of what we are looking for and therefore further enhances our experience of gathering
            information to one that is more personalized and therefore understandable. 
       </P>


        
    <P>
        'As We May Think' breaks down to us just how our 
        experience of gathering information can be made easier via association and this results in the making of gathering information 
        much more understandable and therefore expands our thought processes, knowledge and our overall abilities to grasp any information
         that we would like to learn. This is actually such an insightful reading especially with how the internet works today with the 
         interests of catering to the interests of the users. The internet can associate information for us to the extent that we are able to 
         receive information based off what we consume on the daily on the internet. Think of the idea of algorithms, where the internet and
          social media can associate pieces information according to the things that we are interested in and most likely to search for. Apart
           from that alone, when you search for something on the internet, you are most likely to learn more than what you had initially intended to,
            just based off the fact that we can receive access to more information and insight on the initial idea that you had intended to search for. 
    
    </P>
       

            <P>
                A nice example is when one searches up football games, not only does one receive the football games from the past and upcoming football 
                fixtures but also receives pages such as blogs about these games, information about the players involved in the games and even the insight on the players' 
                conditions and quotes before the game. I didn't search for those specifics, but these are the ideas and concepts that are associated to the terms that I had
                 initially searched for. In conclusion, the reading makes complete understanding of the process of association and how this concept is one that is there with 
                 the intent
                  of making one gather information and learning new things much easier.

        <h3>Interesting things you have found about the History of the Web</h3>
    </div>
   
    <P>
        The internet began on the very much a basic level and according to the article, Later, Navigator: How Netscape Won and Then Lost
     the World Wide Web by Matt Blitz, he describes the early internet as “a cluttered mess of simple text.” From this he describes the
      difficulty of navigating the internet and how it was an impossible experience to enjoy. He also brings up the fact the first photo
       was only uploaded on the internet in 1992. So, until then, all that one saw on the web was just words cluttered everywhere.
    </P>

        <P>
            The internet was not at some point, an actual encyclopaedia where one could find the information that they were looking for, but this
            changed when Andreessen and Bina decided to enhance on the already existing browser to make it more user friendly. It is also very 
            interesting to know that Netscape was actually ahead of Microsoft in terms of the knowledge of the browser, especially seeing that
             today, Microsoft is still very much a staple in the world of the internet. These two companies were actually rivals in their time
              with Netscape being ahead of Microsoft due to Netscape having access to the browser. It’s also very interesting to see how Netscape
               last the legal battle against Microsoft and that today, the company no longer exists while Microsoft is still going strong today.

    <h3>Goals for this course</h3>
</div>
    
<P>
    My goal for this course is to critically understand the internet and its importance thereof. I want to grasp an understanding of what
    the internet is and how it came to what it is today, I believe that it is important to understand the history of something before you
    actively begin to work with it full time. My goal is also to learn how to create websites that people can visit where I can actively
    display work and activities that I have managed to do overtime, and just like Vannevar Bush’s intent to use the internet to help
    benefit humanity, I want for the websites that I create to also benefit humanity so much so that it is remembered and constantly
    revisited for reference in the near future and further down the line. I would also like to learn about using HTML as well as CSS
    and learn the coding language of JavaScript, which has always been something that I have been looking forward to, specifically
    learning a new coding language either than C#.
