    <h3>Reflect on this week's reading by Moulthrop. How does it speak to the internet today? </h3>
</div>
    
<P>
    This week, I was tasked to read "You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media" by Stuart Moulthrop.
    The reading makes us aware of how the internet has revolutionized overtime, as we see that the internet relies on the
    concept of association where there is a link between information within its structure. This revolution results in a
    different way in which we approach reading and the consumption of information on the Internet, from a structure that
    was linear as it did not help us access information in ways that consumers could learn new things. This transition
    from the linear way that we consume information on the internet to a more interconnected structure draws from the
    theories of Marshall McLuhan and how the media has impacted society.
</P>

<P>
    The reading takes influence from McLuhan, who emphasizes the concept of “Medium is the Message”. This concept thoroughly
    explains to us that hypertext as a new medium is what is crucial in how we consume information on the internet today.
    In last week’s reading, the term of “association” was brought up where understand that media is better consumed when
    interlinked with each other. The point was brought up that we learn and understand more information when it is linked
    to one another, and this allows us the opportunity to explore and understand new information that is linked to what we
    are looking for. This allows for a change in the way that one consumes information on the internet, where we are
    introduced to several paths on the internet that therefore results in the reader having interest in the information
    that they delve into while looking for content in the internet. 
</P>

<P>
    The way that the internet used to function was via traditional text, but hypertext diverges from this and as hypertext
    allows for internet consumers that are looking for information to navigate their way through different information and
    parts of the internet through what we call links. This also emphasizes on association, where we see that the idea of
    consuming information on the internet in a linear structure does not provide the opportunity for interaction and learning.
    What the hypertext does is provides the internet user an easier way to grasp and learn information, prioritizing the human
    interaction with technology. The hypertext makes sure that consumers of information have their own directions and links
    that they follow to further enhance the learner and reader experience.
</P>

<P>
    This overall gives the reader and consumer a more personalized experience that will urge them to continue engaging with
    the information instead of passively consuming information in a way that would result in a lack of learning due a failed
    personal experience. The reading also makes the point of how hypertext as a navigation system on the internet can be
    pivotal for in the fight for social change. Moulthrop suggests this as hypertext can be a way that people can be exposed
    to new information raising awareness on social change and therefore allowing for more than one idea to thrive in the
    internet ecosystem, resulting in it being a place where different social ideas can thrive therefore, resulting in an educated society.
    Moulthrop uses the example of "Xanadu" which is a hpertext system used on the internet and how this system of hypertext is also an example
    of how technology and the internet has evolved today and how everything on the internet is interlinked to one another making information'
    easier to access.

    </div>
    
    
    <P>
        The folder structure that I decided to go for was to put all of my blogs in a separate folder all while making sure the index also has a
        separate folder. In the blogs folder, I will have each of my weekly blogs that will separate each of the Week's Blog Posts into different 
        files therefore, resulting in separate html pages to accommodate for each week's information. This is to avoid any confusion for finding
        the blogs and also preparing for having separate pages for each blog so that when the opportunity comes for designing our websites, each of
        the blogs will have separate pages with separate information.

    <P>The following are examples of my URL schemes based off the structuring of my folders:</P>

<article class="Wireframes">
<div class="heading">
    <h3>
        Put in images of your first wireframe ideas and explain what you are thinking of doing.

    </P>
</div>
   
    
    <P>
        The initial plan that I had for this wireframe was that I wanted to look something like a football/clothing website, hence my inspirations
        draw from football and clothing websites that I will document later in this blog. My idea was to have a big search bar in the top centre
        of the screen as this is important for someone who wants to find certain things on the website quickly. I believe that a search bar is
        important as it serves the purpose of efficiency on the website, helping website users find what they are looking for at a quick time.
        I wanted to also have a layout where there is the biggest picture that shows an image and text that welcomes you to the website. As
        the website loads, it then has an arrow that shows where you can access more information about the website and what to expect as you
        navigate the website and what interlinked content that you can find when you’re on the website. I also wanted to have a logo for my
        website in the centre of the top bar of my website. That way, when scrolling, the logo stays on the screen and that serves as the
        identity of the website. I wanted there to be an extras tab also where you could also get extra things such social media information,
        LinkedIn profiles, etc, that would be crucial for anyone who would like to discover anything more about me on a more personal level.
        The panels will be three on the screen where one will consist of all of the weekly blog posts that we did in the semester and then
        the second would be the portfolio side of things where all my works will be displayed and then the last panel will contain any images
        that show my work.

<article class="Reflections">
    <div class="heading">
        <h3>
            Reflect on interaction and the WWW: What does interaction mean to me?
        </h3>
    </div>
    
    <P>
        The word wide web is tool that we have been using for almost all of our
        lives and its functionality has been essential in our understanding of
        information and our journeys of learning new this and being informed
        about the things occurring in the world today. Through this experience,
        I have always appreciated just how easy it is to access information
        without having to search high and low for it and this is what is
        important especially for someone interacting with the World Wide Web,
        information at your fingertips at a quick time too. 
    </P>
    <P>
        When one interacts with the internet, it is important to understand
        that the process has to be one that functions so well to the extent
        that is almost hassle free where one can gain all the information
        that they need at a quick time all while being introduced to new things
        that link to what they are learning. With this, the process of interaction
        becomes one that is not only understandable but also very enjoyable. 
    </P>
    <P>
        When I interact with something, it first has to catch my eye immediately!
        If it successfully catches my eye, it gives me all of the reason to engage
        with it. This is why user interface is important for interaction as it
        serves at the attraction point that gives the user reason to be engaged.
        It is important to think about where you elements on your website will
        be, from your scroll and search bar and how people will click on information
        in order to access it. Think about how easy or sophisticated you want the interaction
        with the website to be and if this is beneficial for the website that you are developing.
        Your aim should be to satisfy your users as well as have a satisfiable and easy to navigate
        experience when working with a website and just like this, you’re a step further in enhancing
        one’s interaction experience with your website.
    </P>
    <P>
        Which brings me to the next idea that I believe is important for someone who uses the internet,
        and an aspiring web developer is that the feedback that the website gives to users must be both
        effective and efficient. This means that when a user searches for something on the web, they
        must be able to find it and it must be made available to them in a way that helps the quickly.
        This feed back is essential in the user knowing what further steps to take and whether or not
        the website is responsive or not. Making the website flow to an extent that it is responsive
        and on time with feedback that it gives ensures that the user does not have any hassles when
        experiencing the website. This is why it is also important understand that as the users interact
        with your website, the build a connection with the website and therefore they either feel good
        or bad experiencing the website as a whole. Therefore this results in the user finding what they
        are looking for all the while enjoying what the website has to offer them. 
    </P>
    <P>
        Which brings us back to the beginning point, where we understand that the technical aspects of
        the website may be the ground work of it all, but if it isn’t an experience that one enjoys
        without any problems while having an experience that is enjoyable too, the website then falls
        short and affects the overall interactive experience which is why my goal overall is to create
        educational experiences all the while having a good experience navigating those educational
        experiences too.
