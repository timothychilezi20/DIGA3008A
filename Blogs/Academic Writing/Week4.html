        GOAL ALIGNMENT
    </h3>
    <P>
        The process of making a website has highlighted specific goals for me, and with inspiration taken from other
        websites, my aim is to create an experience where the user of my website can easily navigate through, while
        also prioritizing the concept of simple but effective aesthetics. What I wanted mainly for this website is for
        it to incorporate factors in the navigation bar such as icons, while also looking into the use of simple base
        colour backgrounds, where each of the icons in the navigation bar led you to different sections on the website.
    </P>

        Overall, it is important to consider the way I want things to be placed, and I appreciate the approach of simplicity
        as it makes the navigation process much easier to work and considering the audience that I want to interact with my
        website, i.e. potential employers, fellow web designers and even aspiring game developers. This website will not only
        serve as site where one can find information about myself, but it will also be a portfolio where I will showcase any
        drawing, works of writing, games and game development processes as well as the blogs that I have been doing that have
        been documenting my journey of making a website.

    INTERFACE ELEMENTS
  </h3>

  <P>
    The plan for my website is simple, but effective and the approach that I would like to take for my interface elements will also
    follow that theme. On the left-hand side of the screen, I wanted there to be the navigation bar that would display the icons of
    the different sections in my website. That being my home page, where if you click on it, it is an introduction page to my website
    on which you can find information about me and what the website is about when you interact with the about tab. The home screen will
    display a picture of me, accompanied by my name and a welcome text that one can interact with which will lead to the section that are
    about me. The next icon will be the blogs icon represented by a paper and pen, and this will be the page where one can access my weekly
    blogs from this year so far. I would also like to have an academic blog section which will display the academic growth that I have made
    in the course all while also having a personal blog section that will contain any personal blogs that I have written.  The next icon will
    be a portfolio icon that will lead to any work that I have done over the years that I want to display and, in the portfolio, will contain
    artworks, games and writing tasks that I have done so far.

    The website of Petersham Nurseries is exactly the approach that I think of when it comes to utilizing the ‘simple but effective’ concept.
    The website makes use of a green and white throughout, with imagery that is used to accompany the simple colour palette that the website
    uses. The idea of having the website’s navigation bar on the side is almost executed the way that I intend to execute my website, but I’d
    like for the navigation bar and the icons that I will be using to be vertically placed on the side. My logo will also appear on the header,
    and you can have the opportunity to scroll from the welcome text down to the other information that will be found about me. The pictures
    that will pop up when you scroll down will be describing what to expect when you visit the website and let you also know where to click if
    you want to access the parts of the website that are shown on the home page.

    Yes, I know, the famous Ulwazi. Here you wonder how one could be inspired by this website where a lot of our misery is found? Well, the great
    thing about this website is the way that the navigation bar is executed on this website perfectly displays how I would want for my side nav bar
    to look in my website too. The icons in a vertical format, but this time without the words, so that when you hover over the icons, the words pop
    up, showing you what that icon is meant to represent. The navigation bar consistently stays on your screen and its colour changes once you actively
    click on it.

  <h3>
    DEFINE YOUR VISUAL AESTHETIC
  </h3>

  <P>
    I wanted my website to have a sort of brown and white colour palette and the images that I will be working with will also display the colours that
    I chose to work with on my website. The brown and white palette will be the main palette that I am aiming to use but I am indeed also open making
    use of black colours for the font and to display the icons that have been clicked on. The use of two colours in the aesthetic will complete or define
    exactly what I intend for the concept of simple but effective.

  <h3>
    REFLECTION
  </h3>

  <P>
    The process of creating this website is one that required me to think outside of the box. From the aesthetics to the simplicity of navigating the website,
    all of these are important and essential to the process. When I first came across the idea of forming a fully functioning website, it was very difficult to
    grasp completely what was required to get a website working well and this tainted my experience, making it more challenging to work with, even to the extent
    where my base wireframes were not up to the standard that I wanted them to be at. But overtime, with advice and research, it was clear to see that most websites
    are inspired by others, and it is through that inspiration that one can design the ideas that the have and make them come to life. The steps we took in learning
    about HTML were steps that I enjoyed taking and with its challenges, the feeling of finally understanding the functionality of the microformats and articles, etc.,
    is one that makes the whole experience of learning HTML an experience that is worthwhile.
