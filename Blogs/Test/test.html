            <h3 id="quote">In conclusion, the evolving relationship between AI and creativity, incites both feelings 
                of excitement and concern in the hearts of many people. Weâ€™ve seen how ethical challenges like consent, 
                labour, and data ownership need more transparent and fair AI practices, in order for people, especially 
                creatives, to feel more comfortable with it being used all around the world. Through the lens of individuation,
                AI is not considered just a tool, but a dynamic partner in the creative process. And it does a great job at reshaping 
                our understanding of authorship and artistic identity.
