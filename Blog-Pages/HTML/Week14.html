        The Concept of Ethical Design: Simplicity and Clarity are More Than Enough
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Wow! Last blog post! We have arrived! AMAZING JOY I FEEL! 
    </p>

    <p>
        The question that we were asked for this week’s blog post is how we would approach justice and ethics in our artistic and programming practices, and this has become a very important consideration to have especially artists and future web developers. An article by Geeks for Geeks last updated in 2024 highlights how ethical design is not only engaging and user friendly, but should also be responsible, inclusive and aligned with social values, and so it is very essential to consider the user’s privacy and always ensure that your user is protected and their information is just as protected. This is considered a very fundamental ethical responsibility for UX designers, and I want to ensure that whenever interacts with anything that I have designed, there needs to be transparency between the creator and the consumer. It is basically my job and designers alike to ensure that the data that users store within our websites is secure. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I also want to make sure that that as I improve on my artistic and programming practice, I ensure that my designs are accessible to everybody and make sure that all feel included when interacting with any artistic and programming works that I have done. To define what accessibility is according to Geeks for Geeks’ article titled Ethical Considerations in UX design, it is a design principle that talks about designing products and services in an all-inclusive manner. So, it is our job as designers to make sure that whatever designs we create, it is inclusive and considering all walks of life, making sure that there is no exclusion that will probably result in one feeling uncomfortable or dissatisfied when using your website. It is basically designing for each and everyone considering the people that have special needs and ensuring that your user experience caters to those needs for a smooth user experience for all. It is also important to note that cultural backgrounds, diversity and abilities are considered so that there are equal opportunities for everyone to explore and understand what you design. I would basically ensure that I conduct surveys and ask people about what I should consider implementing for future designs to make sure that it is all inclusive and with that, of course, conduct my own research and ideas. 
    </p>

    <p>
        There should be no biases or any forms of discrimination whatsoever especially as designer, and this touches on the idea of inclusivity. Factors such as gender, race, age and socioeconomic status should not be discriminated against especially in your UX design as a programmer or even in art as an artist. You must be aware of the way that you navigate those biases to ensure that everyone has a good user experience. Equality and respect must always be key and that way, you will always succeed as a designer. You work for the people and not for yourself. Always remember that. Yes sure, you’re not always going to be spot on with the way the way that you design, but there should be evident effort for the consideration of people around you and all walks of life in the world. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Another one that I learned about this year that is very important is the manipulation tactics that we implement as designers. Whether we like it or not, design is a form of persuasion and yes, this sounds very crazy, but it is very true! It is our jobs to persuade users via our designs and the way that we implement inclusivity, but do NOT let it get to the extent of manipulation! It is our job to ensure that us as UI/UX designers avoid any forms of manipulative and deceptive practices that will end up exploiting our users and make them vulnerable. You should aim to persuade your users when they come across your website but do ensure that you are keeping it within their human rights and are not crossing any lines to an extent of manipulation. 
    </p>

    <p>
        From this alone, it is important to note that ethical design is a form of design that makes use of the mindset that you have for the people and the world around you. Your mindset should be reflected by the way that you aim to implement or fully implement things into your website. Ethical design all in all is how we aim to maintain the trust of the people in the digital world.
