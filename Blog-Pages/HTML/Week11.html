<section class="column">
    <p>
        The reading that I have interacted with for this week’s blog posts is titled, “Making a Feminist Internet in Africa: Why the Internet Needs African Feminists and Feminisms.” From this title,
        I could immediately understand that the author, Sheena Magenya’s aim was to offer critique of the current internet model and how it does not cater for the many groups of people from all around 
        the world. In this article, she expands on how the internet needs more feminists in order to highlight the fact that it is indeed not a fact that the internet “levels the playing field for all”. 
        The aim of this article is to highlight just how necessary it is for feminist perspectives to be present in the digital/internet landscape that should aim to challenge the existing powers that 
        dominate these spaces in order to accommodate for inclusivity. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Magenya begins the article with a quote that aims to capture the attention of readers, stating that, “The saying “we live in interesting times” has never been more true than now.” (Magenya, 2020). 
        She then begins to expand on this by highlighting the Covid-19 crisis that plagued the world and the functionality of its people and speaks of the ‘supposed’ solution that was meant to mend the crisis 
        that all people around the world were faced with. During such a time of crisis, the internet was flooded with beneficial information from trusted sources such as the World Health Organization, and at 
        the same time the internet was also filled with misinformation on the virus that caused a mass panic. Magenya brings up a point here which I looked at and thought, “She is indeed onto something,” and 
        it immediately opened my eyes that the idea of everything moving online during the Coronavirus pandemic was basically us saying that it can solve all social problems that we are facing. But did we think 
        that at the time which the world was plagued with the virus that there would be people around the world that would not have access to internet?  
    </p>

    <p>
        This is where the feminist touch comes in. African feminism on and around the internet is needed! These figures on the internet are there to challenge the idea that technology is somewhat of a levelling field, 
        a factor that benefits all, the solution to all of the social problems that the world faces. To be specific, feminism according to the Cambridge Dictionary is a movement for women’s rights and equality, 
        emphasizing that the aim of feminism on the internet is to create an equal space not just for women, but for all underrepresented groups. The article begins to explain the “Making a Feminist Internet in Africa” 
        gathering that was hosted in October 2019 organized by the Association for Progressive Communications (APC). 
    </p>

    <p>
      This event gathered 50 feminists from 19 different African countries in order to discuss how they can have an active role in making sure that the internet is inclusive and accommodates for all have the opportunity to 
      use it. From these meetings emerged the ‘Feminist Principles of the Internet (FPIs) which is a feminist analysis of how the internet and technology impacts our lives. What this has done has created an opportunity for 
      people in Africa to have access to the internet. Magenya uses Kenya an example in her analysis, in that the active internet users have increased by 15 million. She emphasizes that these numbers are from social media 
      platforms that have more female voices and also LGBTQIA voices that are setting and debunking old ideas that roam around on the internet. What the inclusion of feminism on the internet has done is provide a space where 
      voices can be heard. It is also stated that there has been an increase in the report of gender-based violence cases online. 
    </p>

     <p>
      But Magenya also emphasizes that technology has resulted in a reality where online issues and realities do not have any processes or resource offline. She brings up the point of how online gender-based violence has been a cause 
      of concern that has been raised by women and these issues are unfortunately left alone and not dealt with because of the lack of legislation or an absence of legislation in these African countries. She uses the words “safe space” 
      to describe the environment that the internet has become especially in the prospect of attacking women, which is truly ironic as it serves as a place where people aren’t held accountable for their actions, especially with regards 
      to attacking women online. She states a very important quote that summarizes the state of the online world and that is, “the inequality of access to and representation on the internet is fast replicating existing oppression and 
      suppression.” (Magenya, 2020). 
    </p>

     <p>
       What I love about this article is that it is making so much evident to me that at first, we may have ignored, but then these are actually serious topics that need to be addressed in the online space. Magenya speaks on how Africa is 
       positioned to be a beneficiary of technology, stating how African people have technology as a means to help with the problems that exist in the continent, rather than technology being an innovator that allows for us to create and come 
       up with concepts for fun and pleasure rather than trying to solve the problems evident in the continent. The technological developments that take place in Africa are normally responses to crises such as drought and famine. The internet 
       seems to have played a role on the way that we perceive the world around us and the way that we perceive ourselves, as Africans. Our perceptions are controlled by westernized ideas and media that we consume from the very internet that 
       we claim to be a productive and progressive tool. Instead of offering us clarity, we rather are offered misconceptions about the way that we live. 
    </p>

    <p>
       Mainly, what this article made evident to me is that the internet is an unequal space that replicates the unequal ways that are evident around the world as a whole. It is the responsibility of not just feminists, but for people that are 
       responsible for designing spaces online to make sure that the internet replicates the same, “kind of kindness and care that we move wit when trying to understand the various problems that we live with,” (Magenya, 2020). This can only be 
       achieved by African feminists occupying spaces online and spreading views that advocate for equality in the online space.
