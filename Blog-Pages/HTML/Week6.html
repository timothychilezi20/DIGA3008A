    <h3>Style Guide</h3>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
</div>
    
<P>
    Over the weeks, my goals for the layout have completely changed, from the use of icons, navigation bars, colour palettes and even the way which I want for my content
    to be placed on the screen, my ideas have seen a sense of growth and more clarity from what it once was. The vibe that I am going for now completely suits the idea that
    I have been aiming for throughout the creation of this website, and that is for users get the feel of elegance with the sense of simplicity when navigating each of my pages.
    It is for certain that my idea is going to change drastically and this week, I will be demonstrating the revolution of my website idea and what I want to achieve from it when
    it is all done.

    <h3>Banner Display of Images</h3>
</div>

<P>
    Inspired by websites such as Life Grand Café and Petersham Nurseries, my idea was to have a header with a banner at the top of each of the pages of my website
    and in this banner, an image will show, with what each page is about, for example, the blog page will have a banner with the title of ‘Blog Page’ where an image 
    associated to the concept of blogs will occupy the banner and the text therefore overlaps it. This display captures the attention of the reader and makes use of 
    imagery to bring the concepts of the website to life. The banner display makes sure you understand what you’re getting into by being able to read and also visually 
    form an idea in your head of what you’ll be reading about. 
</P>

        <div class="heading">
            <h3>
                Buttons
            </h3>
        </div>
        
        <P>
            The use of buttons in my website will be very minimal as I feel that clicking on the words keeps to the theme and overall aesthetics that I was aiming for.
            But then, the buttons seem to work well in one place, and that is at the bottom of the screen of all of my blog pages where users can navigate to other blog 
            posts, just by the click of a designated button. To blend in with the colours that I have selected, which I will display, the buttons have to be a shade darker 
            than the background with the hover colour being even darker and even the active button needs to show a change of colour to make sure that the user knows that 
            they are on that designated blog number. Visual communication is important and since there are multiple blogs that the user is going to have to navigate, these 
            buttons direct the user to blog pages easily and without having the hassle of pressing the browser’s back button. 
        </P>

        <div class="heading">
            <h3>
                Header and Footer
            </h3>
        </div>
        
        <P>
            The header and footer at first were a bit of a disaster in my first plan, but then I thought it would be a great idea for the website to have a nav bar in the 
            header instead of the side of the screen. The nav bar will no longer be represented by icons but rather by words that will change colour whenever the user hovers 
            over them and becomes bold when the user is active on the selected page. Another idea change was with the logo of which I though would make sense to have in the 
            middle since my navigation icons would be on the left-hand side of my page, but with the navigation now occupying the right-hand side of the nav bar, it made sense 
            to have my logo on the left-hand side. The footer remained the same, with the intent of it being at the bottom of the screen and having links to my various contact 
            details or social media pages. The header should stay fixed and on screen regardless of whether or not I scroll. 
        </P>

        <div class="heading">
            <h3>
                Description Blocks
            </h3>
        </div>
        
        <P>
            Right beneath each of my banners for each page (except my Blog Pages), will be a description block, a shade darker than my header and footer, to accommodate for my 
            description text that will tell users what the page that they are on is all about and what to expect that page that they are on. This is crucial for the user to understand 
            what the page is about while making use of the banner image and heading. 
        </P>

    </div>
    
    <P>
        Montserrat Font is an elegant font that is part 
        of the Normal family. This font works well for normal 
        texts in blog post and can make the body of your website 
        sections look good and simple while when bold and have a 
        heavy font weight, it stands out and can make for a suitable 
        heading. Compared to the Abril Fatface font, this font occupies 
        space without looking too heavy or out of place especially for my 
        website’s aesthetics.
