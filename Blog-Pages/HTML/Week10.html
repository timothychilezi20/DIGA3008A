    <p>
        The reading that I will be analysing for this week’s blog post is centred around how geography has effect on the growth of the internet and how these
        two elements work together all in all. From what the reading states, this piece serves as an observation of the internet and geography and dismantles 
        the idea that the internet is being lost within geography, and yes, it can be argued that this does have an effect on the full functionality of the internet but overall, 
        this article that I will be further elaborating on in this post is a stance in the idea that location serves as a powerful factor in determining who benefits from technologies 
        in the digital spaces. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In the reading, Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb argue the idea that that the internet does not serve as a form of digital technology that keeps the world equally in tune with each 
        other, specifically meaning that the not everyone around the world has the same access or even the privilege of accessing the Internet the way that other parts of the world or country 
        do. It is pointed out that the reason behind these factors is the fact that elements that are required for digital communication such as infrastructure are not to be found in all parts 
        of the world. They are in fact, unevenly spread around the world where some parts benefit massively while others suffer from the lack of these resources meaning there is no support for 
        the functionality of internet access. For instance, the reading highlights how the rural areas consist of the “highest value users of internet technology,” (4: 2020) it is also stated 
        that “the costs of adaptation may be the highest because of the access of key complementary inputs such as broadband services, skilled labour and third-party services,” (4: 2020). This 
        displayed something to me upon this article’s analysis and that is the fact that the socio-economic patterns in parts of the world influence the way that internet can be accessed and 
        how it is distributed. 
    </p>

    <p>
       It is also emphasized that the access to internet is mainly centred around the complements that are necessary to access the internet and the reading states that that these complementary 
       assets are increasing in locations around the world. Outsourcing firms that provide internet access and services are normally the influencers or determining factors to the adoption costs 
       of internet in parts of the world. This is why it is important to note that just having access to the internet alone does not determine successful internet access connectivity and assets 
       are needed for the internet’s distribution. “The supply of third-party outsourcing firms that are used in IT implementations are increasing in location size as are the use of outsourcing 
       services (Arora and Forman, 2007; Ono, 2007). For regions around the world that have access to these third-party services and can afford them, have a better chance of making use of the internet 
       in its highest functionality, taking advantage of the opportunities that the internet offers. 
    </p>

    <p>
       The article also expands on the IT adoption amongst individuals and how studies have shown individual internet adoption in rural areas and urban areas. This is a result of other factors that may 
       contribute to the expansion of internet access such as income, age, and education (e.g. Hindman, 2000; Mills and Whitacre, 2003). The reading also expands on spillover effects, which are the unintended 
       costs or benefits that a third-party experiences because of a transaction, and the positive effects of this. A business that adapts to digital technologies in a successful way will most likely benefit 
       other businesses that are in the same area. It is stated that adoption is correlated among users in the same metropolitan statistical area (Agarwal et al. 2009). It is important to also note that the 
       benefits mentioned above are mostly limited to parts of the world where economic foundations are strengthened. The results gathered in the reading are mainly from regions with “high-housing density” and 
       regions with “dense-network of social interactions”. (2020: 5). In contrast, areas that have a weaker economy can result in failed internet access or gaining of internet access resulting in an economic divide. 
    </p>

     <p>
       The factors of convergence and divergence poses as a big debate within the readings as Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb expands on these ideas thoroughly. To break them down, the Convergence theory basically 
       speaks of how the internet can be of assistance to the growth of economically isolated areas and rural areas via the lowering of the cost of communication and transaction costs. The Divergence theory is a theory 
       that supports the idea that the internet benefits are only functional in wealthy areas, which are regions that have skilled workers, growing and already grown industries and businesses and infrastructure that can 
       accommodate for strong internet connectivity. The reading substantiates the divergence theory as it suggests that “IT investment is complementary with skilled labour (e.g. Katz and Autor, 1999; Autor et al., 2003), 
       which is found in larger quantities within cities. (2020: 5). The evidence in this reading further leans towards the divergence theory as it shows that the investment in the internet infrastructure in the United States 
       especially within United States counties, there has only been growth of employment and wages in 6% of the United States counties. The relationship between advanced internet infrastructure investments and local economic 
       outcomes was conducted. With their conducted findings, they found that even though there is a growth of internet infrastructure in the United States, there economic benefits did not seem to match up as based on the 2 743 
       counties that research had been conducted across, 6% of the United States’ population displayed a growth of wages and employments. 
    </p>

     <p>
       The reading also brings up valid points about each of these counties, which are the fact that they already had a high amount of income, high populations, a higher number of pupils that can take on skilled labour and most 
       importantly, an extensive use of information technology. These counties experience an average wage growth of 28% from the years of 1995 to 2000 compared to the rest of the nation that just experienced an average wage growth of 
       20%. The rest of the counties in the United States, specifically those that are situated within rural areas and economically underdeveloped regions of the country, the investments into the internet did result in any growth of 
       employment or even of the percentage increase of wages. What this does is demonstrate that technology only serves as a boosting factor to already existing advantages rather than it being a factor that can be considered a factor 
       that makes people and things around a country or the world equal. The already benefited and growing counties from the conducted research can use internet to further expand on their growth but the remaining counties that do not have 
       access to business and infrastructure will have a tough time trying to make internet access an economic, beneficial factor. An advanced internet infrastructure makes way for an increased productivity and earnings of areas that are already 
       well-positioned to benefit from the wealth that the have already established. So, this completely debunks the idea that internet technology has bridged the gap between the rich and poor, it has rather only widened the gap. 
    </p>

    <p>
       Forman et al. (2015) investigated on whether the Internet has increased or decreased the concentration of invention and the results from this demonstrated that the internet works against the concentration of invention. So, despite the 
       massive investments in digital infrastructure, there has only been a small amount of the country that has economically benefited from the integration of digital infrastructure and these are the areas that already had somewhat of a boost 
       or were somewhat ahead of the developmental curve. The internet’s economic effects are based on already existing economic, social and geographical conditions where the Internet functions. Expanded internet access is not a guarantee of 
       overall impact because without supporting factors such as education, infrastructure and the supports of institutions such as universities, the impact that internet access is meant to have will be minimal and therefore less impactful. 
       Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb make it known to us in this study that to bridge the gap between the digital divide of rural and urban areas, it is essential to find ways that are ensured to interconnect with people around the world, rather 
       than only parts of the world that already benefited. Overall, it is important to note that technology and geography work hand in hand with each other in that each of them contributes to one another. The expansion of internet access alone is 
       not enough and investment in infrastructure should be based on educational programs and improvement of workforce to ensure that rural and less developed areas can expand on and build the assets that are needed to progress in the digital world. 
    </p>

    <p>
       To summarize the major points in this reading, it firstly and mostly important to note that geography is still a very important factor in how the digital world operates. The investing on the internet also highlights the inequalities between rural 
       and urban areas; where technological development only sustains the areas that have already been developed in the technological instance, increasing the gap between them. It is also important to note that complementary assets are integral for the 
       measurement of how digital technology benefits or disadvantages parts of the world. Urban areas are most likely to be advantaged based on the way that they operate to sustain industries of complex nature.
