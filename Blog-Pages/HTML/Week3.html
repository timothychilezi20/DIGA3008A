    <h3>
        Working through the slides for Interaction Design for the web, define and discuss your user alignment,
        and map out your site's content, experience, and interface elements.
    </h3>
</div>
     
    <P>
        According to the slides for the Interaction Design, something is deemed as interactive if it is responsive
        in a way that is understandable and relevant to the information that you search for, therefore making
        understanding of what you are looking for and making it sensible in a way that a consumer can understand and
        learn from. For example, a user of the internet, which is defined as the actor, interacts with the system and
        expects an interaction that would be beneficial based on the information that they want to find out about. The
        system then allows for the actor to make observations of the system represented and then the actor acts, and we
        therefore see a change in the system, being either internal or external change. 
    </P>
    
    <P>
        The slides also cover the concept of interface and how this is the meeting point between the user and the system.
        This is what brings out and what symbolizes what an interaction between the actor and the system will be. The
        interface is further described as a semiotic system that is a system of signs meant to convey meaning. The interface
        makes sure that it shows and means interactions (embodies) and therefore also makes the system do things (enables).
        The interface serves a way that was designed for users’ interactions with the system to be represented. Which leads
        to the next topic of Interaction Design (IxD) which contains Information Architecture, described as the labelling and
        organizing of content to make the website user friendly and understandable, User Experience (UX), based on the feelings
        of the user while interacting with your website and lastly the User Interface (UI), which serves as the looks of your
        website and how the website appeals to the eye upon interaction.
    </P>
    
    <P>
        Overall, these are all important factors to consider in the alignment, and for my website there some thought out goals
        and perceptions that I have. Firstly, when users interact with my website, I want it to be an opportunity for users to
        see the work and creative processes behind making a website. I would want them to see my name on the website’s page, which
        serves as an indication of who the page belongs to and what the page is about. Users that see this will have an understanding
        or idea of what they will experience and the logos on the side of the screen will be the navigation bar which you can explore
        images, past projects and games that I have worked on, a portfolio of things that I have managed to work on, and access to blogs
        and weekly work that will showcase my growth of knowledge in Interactive Media. 
    </P>
    
    <P>
        My main target audience would be any peers who are looking to be inspired by making websites and interactive experiences, people
        interested in the concepts of art and making games all the while also making it a place for future employers to explore to see the
        skills that I am capable of and the work that I have previously done. An important factor to luring an audience to your website is
        your overall ability to in making sure that your User Experience is efficient and accommodates for your users and the information
        that they are looking for, which is why I will have the layout of different things that a user can click on, being the home page,
        portfolio section, weekly blog section, games section and an images section. 
    </P>
    
    <P>
        The home page will give us access to the index page of the html, where the user will be exposed to the information of the website,
        what it is about, who it is about and what to expect when navigating the website. The portfolio section is where I will have work
        that I did, whether it be from school or even volunteer/holiday work that I took on. This then leads to the games section that will
        display the games that I have over the year and will give players the opportunity to read about the games, what it is about and give
        them access to play the games. The navigation bar will be on the left-hand side of the screen, whereas the different html sites will
        be represented by icons on the side of the screen in the navigation bar.  I’d also like for the option for users to have personal
        experiences on the website by integrating a login system where users can login and personalize their website experience.

        <h3>
            Reflect on how the exercise above relates to what you know about your structure and URL scheme and how it relates to semantic markup.
        </h3>
    </div>
    
    <P>
        These overall map out the experience that I want the users of my website to have when having to encounter it. It was important that I
        paid attention to the factors of User Experience, User Interface and Interaction Design. For this to be successfully achieved, a good
        URL scheme is important for the interaction between the user and the system. As mentioned, the URL structure will follow a structure of
        e.g. Blogs/WeeklyWriting/Week1.html, taking a logical structure where the file structure is described, has hierarchy and makes the page
        navigation easy to understand. 
    </P>
    <P>
        A semantic markup makes use of html elements that are essential in making the website accessible and clear and the markups that we learned
        about such as incorporating headers, adding a navigation bar, and even having ordered lists and unordered lists,
        creates a system of organisation. A semantic html makes sure that the process of navigating the website is one that is both effective and
        efficient, all the while creating a clear idea of what your website is about and what users can expect from it, adding the idea of relevancy
        to whoever may come across your website. 
    </P>
