        The Concept of Ethical Design: Simplicity and Clarity are More Than Enough
    </div>
    
    <p>
        The concept of ethical design has become so important overtime just based off how in today’s world, it is the digital aspects that have an impact on the way that we live and perceive life. Just from the few weeks of analysing what ethical design is, I view it to be a concept that takes into consideration everyone in every walk of life. So, what does this specifically mean? It is practically being able to prioritize the simplicity of navigating a website so that anyone that comes across it has a comfortable experience using it. It is also important to note that ethical design does not just accommodate simplicity, but should also aim to have simplicity, inclusivity of all people and maintain a transparency with the users that come across your website. My aim with my website was to create a user experience that put was thoughtful and where users could access features effectively and without any hassles. A website should be able to cater for users’ needs and also be able to ensure that there is respect for people. I wanted for the implementation of everything that I have implemented into this website to be one that was well thought out and use this as an opportunity to show just how much ethical design can make a difference.
    </p>

    <p>
        From the moment that users enter my website, there should be an immediate instance of clarity and understanding of the website that the users are about to interact with. So, from the navigation bar, there should be an immediate understanding of the content that is part of the website so that users know whether they will find what they are looking for. Think about it, if a user, basically a potential employer opens your website and is not sure of where to go and how to find important information such as your profile that contains your skills and portfolios, then it is already a waste of time. When users see your website, they should immediately know what each page is going to be about or have an idea or some sorts. From my personal perspective, ethical design lies in the transparency that you have with your users. I made a small (BIG) mistake in my previous website submission where I had clickable links that would lead to game downloads or even downloadable assets without any clarity of what the link would do or any instructions of how the content works. The user is blindly lead into territory that could even cause a massive stir up for their laptop, cellphone, etc, and even, just think about how if someone is using data to navigate your website, there is a high risk that the downloadable link could result in a very unsatisfactory feel after interacting with your website. Clarity is extremely important and establish it in every which way possible. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I also wanted for my website to be easy to read and legible for anyone that comes across it because, what is the point of having a website full of content just for it to be difficult to read because you thought it would very cool to use a cursive font?The Montserrat font was suggested to me as advice for the website’s main content as is very easy to read and an adjustable font for different screen sizes, considering that not everyone that sees your website will interact with it on a laptop device. The media queries and the grid flexibility ensure that users across all devices have an experience that is seamless and responsive. When you design ethically, you design for everyone and these aspects contribute towards smooth user experience, keeping in mind and considering that web design is for everyone. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The aspect of efficiency was an important factor to consider towards making my website and this was thought about especially since I basically had a trap of sorts when I had links without any descriptions that would result in downloaded games or blender assets, even without them not wanting to download them. I made use of mp4 videos and GIFs to make sure that players at least have an idea of the game that is being shown in my portfolio before having to find the website. Having knowledge of what you are interacting with is important then it Is up to the user to make use of what is being provided or not. What the use of videos does for the website users is also contribute to better performance and accommodates for slower connections and people that aren’t using Wi-Fi. Making it easier for people to interact with your website is a considerable factor for resource management in the digital realm. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, it is important to make sure that you are authentic about the design choices that you make. What I mainly wanted was simple and effective user experience and I want players to have a user experience that is genuine and aims to have a connection with the people using the website rather than just prioritizing complexity. This website should immediately show who I am and display what I am all about. It should be a capturing of my personality so that people get to know me and understand who I am through just the interactions that they have with my website alone. It is important for users to understand what each page contains and that your links lead to elements that cater to you and what you are about. 
    </p>

    <p>
        From this alone, it is important to note that ethical design is a form of design that makes use of the mindset that you have for the people and the world around you. Your mindset should be reflected by the way that you aim to implement or fully implement things into your website. Ethical design all in all is how we aim to maintain the trust of the people in the digital world.
