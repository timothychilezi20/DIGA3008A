        When coding, especially for a website, it is very important to consider looking at your code through a decolonial aspect. To define the word, decolonialization, according to Oxford Dictionary, is the process of freeing an institution, sphere of activity, etc. from the cultural or social effects of colonialization. The aim of decolonialization overall is to challenge the narratives and ideas that dominate the internet space today. There are existing power structures and biases that exist in the internet space and overtime, it is the task of website designer to inspect these decolonial approaches to understand how to approach software development and website design in a way that is decolonial and breaking the norms that have been established across internet platforms. 
    </p>

    <p>
       One of the things that I realized while designing my website is that we do indeed still follow colonial methods and westernized styles. Especially on my end, my website basically fits into the normalized website standards that have been popularized overtime. For instance, factors such as have a date format, the way that we display our text and even the colour choices that we make are all mainly accommodating for western audiences as we know that this is the audience that has access to the internet and probably the higher chance of accessing websites. When designing the websites, it does not even come across our thought process that the factors that we aim to incorporate into our website are westernized, from the language that we use (English), to the audiences that we aim to cater for. It is important to also look at whether our website disadvantages certain groups of people or even reinforces stereotypes. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Upon designing my website, I realised that most of the pictures that I sourced mostly contain hands or people that are Caucasian, which is quite a funny observation but since these were the best pictures to source based in the quality, I just went along with it. Even in other websites and applications like Canva, things like these make it so evident that websites are following colonial and westernized ideas that we have the responsibility to change. Website developers should consider working on hiring employees that cater to translating websites accurately to further accommodate for non-English speaking audiences. It is also important to make sure that when creating a website that the data collected is in respect to marginalized communities ensuring that there is transparency.

      This event gathered 50 feminists from 19 different African countries in order to discuss how they can have an active role in making sure that the internet is inclusive and accommodates for all have the opportunity to 
      use it. From these meetings emerged the ‘Feminist Principles of the Internet (FPIs) which is a feminist analysis of how the internet and technology impacts our lives. What this has done has created an opportunity for 
      people in Africa to have access to the internet. Magenya uses Kenya an example in her analysis, in that the active internet users have increased by 15 million. She emphasizes that these numbers are from social media 
      platforms that have more female voices and also LGBTQIA voices that are setting and debunking old ideas that roam around on the internet. What the inclusion of feminism on the internet has done is provide a space where 
      voices can be heard. It is also stated that there has been an increase in the report of gender-based violence cases online.

     <p>
      Although I haven’t implemented any JavaScript into my website, I have considered making sure that the website interaction is quick and efficient and makes sure that the user experience is smooth. I also wanted to have interactive elements on my website such as having sliders and responsive buttons such as a back to top button to make sure that the website user can return to the top of a certain page without having to scroll all the way to the top, The aim of implementing JavaScript to my website is to create a smooth and engaging experience where users can get instant feedback when interacting with website elements.
