        <h3>Life Grand Cafe Website</h3>
    </div>
    
    <P>
        The website that I will be analysing this is a restaurant website, specifically, that captures the elegant and simple look that I have been inspired by
        during the creation of my website. Life Grand Café is a restaurant in South Africa known for its exquisite restaurant design, menu and overall restaurant
        experience. On their website, we get a display of the restaurant space, food and website visitors receive the overall aesthetic. In this week’s discussion,
        I will be investigating the pros and cons of this website based on the User Interface and User Experience that I have come across upon this website’s visit.

        <h3>Pros of the Life Grand Cafe Website</h3>
    </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a>
                    The home page gives us access to the food and the drinks menu as soon as you scroll down, and this gives the opportunity for website users to find
                    what they are looking for which is the food that is available to them and how much that food actually is. 
                </a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a>
                    The location of the place is displayed right at the top of the restaurant, and I like how this is in bold and immediately grabs my attention. 
                </a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a>
                    The colour palette is on that is simple, containing white, black, and creamy shades of white which compliment the theme and idea of the
                    restaurant which is exquisite restaurant design. 
                </a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a>
                     The word crossing out when you are on the page in the navigation bar serves as an effective symbol of displaying that the user is in a
                     specific section of the website. 
                </a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a>
                    The website scales well and the responsiveness to a smaller screen, where the quality of the website stays intact, and the content
                    remains visible on the screen. 
                </a>
            </li>
                
        </ul>

        <h3>Cons of the Life Grand Cafe Website</h3>
    </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a>
                    When I visited a page on the website, the navigation bar UI was clashing with the background image, which made it difficult to for me to
                    see the logo and all of the other UI that is on the navigation bar. 
                </a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a>
                    When you scroll down to the bottom of the home page, there are images there, but all of these images are not spaced out, which looks
                    like the images are combined and the space on the website feels cramped because of this. 
                </a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a>
                    I get the idea of the navigation bar, but I prefer for the website to have a solid navigation bar where you can actually see where
                    the navigation bar starts and ends on the screen, since this is the container that people use to get around on the website. 
                </a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a>
                    The is surprisingly a lack of a footer on some pages that I visited on the website and immediately, it gives a lack of consistency.
                    It seems there are only footers on the restaurant pages but even so, they are just the contact details section. 
                </a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a>
                    Words stand to be unclear on the website banners especially if the text blends with the background image. For some, it may be easy
                    to see whereas for most, the words cannot be seen fully. 
                </a>
            </li>
                
        </ul>
