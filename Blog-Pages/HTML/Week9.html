      First Reading: Tataki and Glynos – Digital Divide Widens (2020)
    </div>

    <p>
        In this article, we are informed about the impact that Covid-19 has had on schools resulting in their closure which has the resulted 
        in schools having to conduct education via e-learning systems. This has been seen as an issue as although it may seem as if there has 
        been a solution to a lack of in-person learning during the pandemic, not everyone around the world has access to the internet, therefore 
        making it difficult for learners to access education online. This showcases the idea of digital inequalities, which is the disparity in 
        access to and use of digital technologies, specifically referring to internet connectivity and devices, between different groups of people. 
        What this part of the article highlighted is the digital inequalities that groups of people are faced with, where some groups can access 
        the internet whereas other groups do not have the opportunity to access the internet as easily. The article also provides evidence in research, 
        showing that disparities are evident in low-income countries. According to the research, 82% of students in Sub-Saharan Africa are unable to 
        go online. From this, I got to understand that the concept of digital divide does not just cover the access we have to internet or even devices. 
        It also covers the idea of how technology can cause social exclusion amongst pupils and in this regard, school pupils.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is also highlighted how it is just not school pupils that are affected by this but also the working class. It is stated that the high earning
        occupations enabled the prospect of working at home, as these jobs do not require a constant presence at the office space. What I understand from 
        this article is that even though there are parts of the world that may have access to the internet and devices, this alone isn’t a guarantee to 
        everyone being able to use the internet efficiently. The article demonstrates that digital divide does not just stem from infrastructure but also 
        serves as a form of social exclusion. Students that do have the access to technology end up being marginalized on the social and economic aspects. 
        This article makes it clear that digital access alone is not a guarantee to digital inclusion nor is it a guarantee to digital equality. Areas where 
        Internet and devices are available still experience issues such as lack of quality of internet. The article could have further expanded on how these 
        issues can be solved so that this problem can be tackled around the world, ensuring internet access for pupils and the opportunity for everyone to 
        make use of the access that is available.
