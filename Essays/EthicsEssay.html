    <h3>An Ethics Essay on Naked Insurance Website</h3>
</div>

<P>
    With the evolution of digital world in South Africa, the way in which brands aim to portray their services on digital platforms 
    is a crucial determining factor in a customer’s overall impressions of the brand and the services that they offer. As a digital 
    service in South Africa, a country that is primarily reliant on digital technologies to access information, it is important to 
    consider the concepts of user interaction and user experience design which are crucial in forming the customer’s overall interpretation 
    of a brand and providing a smooth and enjoyable user experience. Especially in an industry like insurance, known for their lack of 
    transparency and complexity, the brand’s website should thrive for a user experience that is easy to navigate and ensures accessibility 
    to important information. Naked Insurance, a newly emerged insurance/Insurtech company which is quickly gaining traction for its services 
    in the South African landscape, has developed a website that emphasizes the importance of simplicity and brand aesthetics. The Naked Insurance 
    website aims for a new and redefined way for users to interact with insurance services, with “No Paperwork, No Phone Calls – Just Better Cover 
    Through Tech.” The following essay will investigate the Naked Insurance website’s overall user experience, user interface, specifically 
    analysing how design plays an important role in transparency and plays an important part in the experiences of the user and especially with a 
    digital insurance platform, effective design is required to enhance the user’s overall trust.
</P> 

<P>
    In the words of the founder of CXL, Peep Laja, “It is the job of the of the website designer to build an interface that minimizes the gap 
    between what users know prior to coming to your site and what they must know when they use it properly.” For an insurance company that 
    operates online with technology, it is important for the visual design to communicate thoroughly what the website is about. Naked insurance 
    thrives at this approach, as it makes use of a modern design approach. The homepage contains a green background with black and white writing, 
    sticking to the brands main colour palette. The logo appears in the left margin of the header, with the navigation bar appearing in the right 
    margin of the header. There is also a pattern that the website follows, where emerald is used to highlight information that specifically 
    attends to the brand and what it is about, the black colour (thunder) is used to highlight important communications and stands out to the 
    green and white backgrounds, ensuring the users’ readability. With a green background, the buttons are black with white text, such as the 
    “Get my price” button, on the homepage, and the button then becomes green with white text when the user scrolls to a white background. 
</P>

<P>
    The website continues to follow the theme of simple, minimalistic approach with the use of a clean, sans serif font. The website makes use of a 
    large size font that is bold, which immediately stands out to catch the user’s attention, sighting what the insurance company offers services for. 
    A transition between the words, ‘Car’, “Home’ and ‘Stuff’ repeatedly transitions on the homepage, highlighting the services that the insurance company 
    offers immediately as the user interacts with the website. That text being in black stands out, with the aim of being memorable, so that the user can 
    actively know and remember the services that the insurance company offers. This is the incorporation of the Von Restorff Effect, which is commonly known 
    as the Isolation Effect, which functions on the idea of standing out, which is that when an object stands out from the rest, it is most likely to be 
    remembered and as a contrast in shape and colour results in memorability. The same effect applies on the Car Page of the website, where blur text and 
    icons are used to display Naked’s ‘CoverPause’ services, that offer clients the chance to pause their insurance cover without any cancellation. To add on, 
    it is important to note that the website is clear and plain making no use of any stock photos that could be found across other insurance websites. Naked 
    insurance relies on it colour palette, use of thematic icons that coordinate with the colour palette and clear language ensures reliability of the brand 
    enforces a trust between the company and clientele. 
</P>

<P>
    The layout of the website follows a simple and user-friendly format, where the header consistently appears on the top of each page, with the logo and 
    navigation bar intact. The header displays a clear border when scrolling down a specific page and gets rid of the border as soon as the user scrolls to the 
    top of the website, making the header blend with the colour of the background. The website also prioritizes efficiency and quickness. Users can get insurance 
    quotes in under 90 seconds, with allocated buttons that lead to insurance prices and signing up for insurance services. The website effectively incorporates the 
    Hick’s Law, which is the simplification of choices based on the number of choices that is made available to a user. The minimal choices that a user must make ensures 
    a speedy decision-making process. Compared to other insurance companies in South Africa, Naked insurance avoids cluttered layouts with buttons and icons spaced out, 
    contains only one drop down menu that consists of three options. Insurance company websites feel corporate and formal, whereas Naked Insurance makes sure that users 
    discover that there is a fun side of insurance, targeting a younger audience and more digitally savvy clientele while also attracting older audiences via their quick 
    and effective useability and navigation. 
</P>

<P>
    The user interface also accommodates for different screen sizes, and is also mobile friendly, where users have the same access and options to choose from on mobile as 
    well as computer and tablet screens. This is known as website responsiveness, which the ability for the website to support accessibility and convenience for users on varying 
    technological devices. It is defined as the ability to adapt automatically to different screen sizes, and this makes sure that the user experience across all devices is consistent 
    and optimal. The website on the phone compared to the laptop device consists of minimal changes such as replacement of a navigation bar with a hamburger menu icon that gives the user 
    access to the other pages available on the website, that would usually occupy the header. With the click of the hamburger menu, a slide menu ensures access to the website content. 
    According to Statista.com, it is revealed that the mobile phone is the most popular and most used technological device in South Africa. The responsiveness of Naked Insurance’s website 
    ensures a user experience that is a quick and effective as is on every other technological device. 
</P>

<P>
    The user experience of a website requires inclusivity, and in the reading, Design Justice: Nothing About Us Without Us, Costanza-Chock highlights the concept of Design Justice, which is 
    an approach to design that is led by marginalized communities, aiming to explicitly challenge, rather than reproduce structural inequalities (Costanza-Chock, 2020). In the reading, she 
    specifies that ethical design should aim to inclusive, participatory and responsive to social inequalities. Naked Insurance’s use of conversational language creates a transparency with 
    website users and company clients, and with the aid of artificial intelligence to create meaningful interactions, this sustains the elements of trust. Their transparency with regards to 
    their pricing allows for all walks of life to engage with the website’s services with a sense of transparency, but the website, based on my observations, the website does lack inclusivity 
    with regards to its design. As Costanza-Chock states in her book, Design Justice asks whether the affordances of a designed object or system disproportionally reduce opportunities for already 
    oppressed groups, while enhancing the life opportunities of dominant groups (Costanza-Chock, 2018, p.41). While I am not stating that the website intentionally excludes marginalized groups, it 
    does not live up to the simple elements of design justice. There is no evident incorporation of user feedback from marginalized groups and factors such as the lack of incorporating different 
    language choices besides English, especially in South Africa, a country with a total of 11 official languages. The lack of consideration for people that do not speak the English language is a 
    considerable shortfall for the website’s design justice. The lack of design justice on the Naked Insurance website is a factor of digital exclusion as mentioned before, the aim of design justice 
    is to incorporate diverse and marginalized groups. If you’re a website that provides services that are meant to cater to everyone, it is important to prioritize the concept of “nothing about us, 
    without us.” A suggestion for this website is to incorporate elements such as alt texts that are specialized to cater for visually impaired website users. 
</P>

<P>
    Another important element to consider in the construction of the website is a concept that has been reiterated throughout parts of this essay which is, the ability to of a website to be trustworthy 
    to users that encounter it, in other words, the lack of dark patterns. Dark patterns are described as design choices that benefit an online service, deceiving users into making unintentional and possibly 
    harmful decisions (Mathur et al, 2019). The dark patterns of a website create an unnecessary urgency for users as I traversed the Naked Insurnce website, it did not have any instances of dark patterns, where 
    I felt pressured to insure with them for their own benefit rather than mine. The website prioritizes quickness and efficiency where users get transparent responses on insurance pricing without any deceptive 
    methods that may get users signed up for any additional charges or coverage. 
</P>

<P>
    Although there aren’t any signs of dark patterns on the Naked Insurance website, I did notice how the use of its artificial intelligence services to assists website users. The artificial intelligence services 
    do not serve as reliable and even though the website claims to have a fair system that is based on collected data, there is no truth or evidence to this claim. The charges that they offer to their users/clients 
    is meant to be based off data, but there comes a small lack of transparency of the fairness of the prices that users/clients are charged. The idea of entering the process of signing up for something as important 
    as insurance with artificial intelligence brought me to unease as it is the AI that deliberates the ‘fair price’ for my insurance claims rather than informed and trusted employees. 
</P>

<P>
    Based on Juned Ghanchi’s article Ethical Design: Why Is It Critical for UX Designers it is the website designer’s responsibility to ensure that a website contains usability, which is how efficiently and satisfactory 
    a user can accomplish a specific goal (Ghanchi, 2021). It is the job of designers to draw the line between white-hat persuasion and black-hat persuasion. Such persuasion tactics that aim to convince users to acquire 
    services blindly just for the benefit of the brand is considered in Ghanchi’s terms, “unethical” (2021). Joseph Mok also emphasizes the importance ethical UX experiences that aim to respect the user’s autonomy, privacy 
    and well-being (2023). Essentially, UX design should mainly prioritize experiences that put the user’s interest’s first (Mok, 2023). The Naked Insurance website ensures a support of autonomy, avoiding any persuasive, 
    black-hat persuasion tactics, which is essentially putting the user’s interests first, rather than aiming to prioritize the company’s benefit. They understand that with the user’s interests being met, this will result 
    in the thriving of their services. 
</P>

<P>
    The last crucial point that I would like to explain is how it is important for a website to consider human-centred crisis communications. Shapochka brings up the point that when designers work on inventing tools such as 
    websites, they should be able to cater for people under real world stress and crisis situations. In this instance, it is the perfect scenario to bring up the website’s accessibility during load shedding, an electricity 
    crisis that South Africa is currently faced with, which also results in a lack of internet access. The interface with it design that can be accommodated for on cellular devices, enhances the user’s experience, ensuring 
    that users of the website can rely on the Insurance company’s services regardless of emergency. This emphasizes the point, that websites should “ensure that all features function reliably without Internet connectivity, 
    anticipating possible network failures (Shapochka, 2025). 
</P>

<P>
    With thorough analysis of the user experience on the Naked Insurance website, the website thrives on the concepts of simplicity and does not indulge in the idea of black-hat persuasion, ensuring that users engage in a 
    trustworthy space. The simple design approach allows for users of all ages to engage with the website and navigate through it with ease. Although the website thrives on these ends, it still has room for improvement with 
    regards to ensuring that the website is inclusive and accommodates for users of different languages and users with visual impairments. With the inclusion of more accessible features, the Naked Insurance website can grow 
    from a great website to a website that is not only easy to get around and is aesthetically pleasing, but it can also grow to become a website that aligns more with the principles of ethical design, evident in the readings 
    from Costanza-Chock and Mok. 
</P>

<P>
    The Naked Insurance website has set the bar for the South African insurance industry, shying away from the corporate and serious approach to insurance, making use of user-friendly interface and making sure that the users and 
    clientele know what they are signing up for all while making sure the navigation process is smooth. There are indeed factors that the Insurance company can improve on especially with the representation of different language 
    groups and accommodation for underrepresented groups. To add on, the use of AI is an efficient tool, but also a risk that requires evaluation. Users have a lack of transparency of where their data is being used and processed. 
    Overall, Naked Insurance, for a new and emerging insurance company has taken steps in the right direction and its future growth is determined by how they apply these ethical principles to their website, ensuring that a site that 
    accommodates for all walks of life, especially for a human service as essential as insurance.
