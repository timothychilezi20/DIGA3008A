    <h3>Starlink: The New Frontier of Digital Colonialism </h3>
</div>

<P>
    The internet has become more than a tool of communication and access to information, but rather, the internet has evolved into a space where powers from all around the world seek control and inequality prevails. The expansion of global connectivity has led to questions about the hierarchal structures that are present on the internet and that is who owns the internet, who benefits from internet connectivity and who is left without any access to the internet. Starlink, an internet service provider by company SpaceX, advocates as a solution to the problem of digital inequality, and with its rapid rise, the focus on digital inequalities has been drastically magnified. The inclusion of Starlink in developing countries such as Nigeria and Rwanda, and conflict struck countries such as Ukraine, highlights problems of digital coloniality more than solves them and that is the pattern of colonialism with the use of 21st century technology. This essay will utilize Starlink as a case study to critically analyse the internet, geopolitics and digital coloniality, and how there are power dynamics within the internet space controlled by private techno companies. 
</P> 

<P>
    The invention of Starlink by SpaceX has taken upon the responsibility of bridging the gap between countries with internet access and countries without internet access, serving as a tool for global development within the internet space. The world was introduced to Starlink geopolitical involvements in 2022 during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Starlink made sure that internet was accessible to conflict zones within the Ukraine to ensure that both the military and the civilians of the country had unlimited access to the internet. On top of that, Starlink has managed to secure licences to operate within countries such as Nigeria, Rwanda, the Philippines, Indonesia and most recently, India. This is impactful as these parts of the world consist of large rural populations and have a lack of internet access due to the financial constraints, affecting the investment in infrastructure for accessible internet such as cell towers and underground cables. This makes satellite internet credible solution. The issue is that initiating satellite internet within some countries comes with its constraints as the low-earth satellites (LEO Satellites), do not operate within national networks and therefore users of Starlink from all around the world will be connected to an infrastructure that is controlled by private cooperation based in the United States of America. This displays dependency of the world on infrastructure from the United States and therefore establishes the United States as that the global controller of any user of the Starlink network. 
</P>

<P>
    Internet Geographies, a reading by Mark Graham (2014), emphasizes that “the internet is not placeless,” and this leads perfectly to the point that “the very act of being online connects users to a geography of servers, cables, and platforms that are unevenly distributed and deeply political” (p. 100). Based on the observations from the previous paragraph, Starlink is a direct example of Graham’s point. The company markets itself as a bridge between the gap of countries with and without infrastructure to ensure internet access and yet it seems to operate within the interests of benefiting the United States as the top of the power hierarchy throughout the entire world. This does not stand for South Africa though, as the country’s Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policies require for local companies to have a stake in the operations of Starlink In South Africa. This was of course met with backlash by company founder, Elon Musk as openly criticized the policies. It was evident to see that there was a clash between the ambitions of local development and the ambitions of global corporate structures. The process of getting Starlink into the Philippines and Nigeria fared off as much simpler with less constraints as there were minimal partnerships that had to be formed and less policies that the company had to abide to. How Geography Shapes-and Is Shaped by-the Internet, a reading by Greenstein, Forman, and Goldfarb (2018), states that “the reach of the internet reflects not only technological capabilities but also geopolitical configurations and regulatory sovereignty” (p.5). Based of this quote, the idea that is created is that Starlink is a representation of the power dynamics present in digital communication space. 
</P>

<P>
    This segways into the concept of digital coloniality as this terms perfectly describes the way in which technological infrastructures play a role in the distribution of colonial patterns in digital spaces today. “Knowledge production control over data, and platform governance remain concentrated in a few global centres.” (p. 1194). This quote from Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results by Ballatore, Graham, and Sen (2017), explains how digital colonialism takes place and this normally results in local ideas and ambitions never thriving. With the way that Starlink operates and how they are controlled from and by the United States already deters any chances of the host nations of Starlink to have a clear understanding of the operational standards and systems of the company. Just imagine the thought of having something fully working and having no clue how it works and no control over it whatsoever?
</P>

<P>
    Another problem stems from this and that is the data collection from all parts of the world where Starlink operates. The data collected immediately moves through the SpaceX networks instead of local internet service providers, completely disregarding laws that some countries have in place in relation to data protection. An interesting article by the iOL states how Elon Musk has taken control over the operations of Starlink, where Musk had been accused of ordering for the network to be turned off near the Crimean coast to misdirect a Ukrainian drone attack on Russian warships. The idea that there is such an easy access to control over the network operations from the comfort of the United States serves as proof that hierarchies in the digital space are pushed and colonial ideas still exist. 
</P>

<P>
    The approval of Starlink in India in 2025 stems as a clear sign of the idea of digital colonialism as after negotiations between Elon Musk and Indian Prime Minister, Narenda Modi, the beginning of Starlink in India took off and even though India viewed this as a boost for their entire country especially since most of the rural parts of their country would finally have internet coverage, this affected the data policies that the country had in place, bypassing any taxation in place in India. Network providers in India have now been forced out of their will to collaborate with Starlink. Graham describes this situation well as he states that “infrastructure decisions made now will shape not just access but the flow of value and influence for decades” (p. 108). The implementation of a network service controlled by the United States in India is the beginning of an India dependant on the digital capabilities and standards of the United States. 
</P>

<P>
    Starlink also poses a threat beyond the aspects of internet connectivity as it raises concerns of platform governance, and since this company is owned by Elon Musk, it is very easy for him to try and control narratives on a platform that he also owns, which is X, formally known as Twitter. Ballatore et al. (2017) explains to us how digital platforms display geographical biases. If an idea or opinion is from the West, it is most likely to be pushed and spread around the world as actual truth. Knowing Elon Musk, his next priority probably lies with the integration of digital networks with content distribution networks to form what is, a digital hegemony, which is described as dominance over digital resources and infrastructure equates to political and economic clout, according to Ran Danish Nisar from wgi.world. So, countries such as Nigeria and the Philippines are prone to being susceptible to American norms and ideas, and this completely removes the voices of any marginalized groups from around the world. The threat of Starlink also operates beyond measure as the network does not need network service providers to operate and this results in the there being a lack of monitoring of criminal activity digitally and minimalizes the chances of countries monitoring content. Greenstein et al. (2018) states that “the politics of internet governance will increasingly be played out through control of physical and logical infrastructure” (p. 11) and this is the lane that Starlink will eventually take as the network is near difficult to shut down or localize. 
</P>

<P>
    Instead of resulting in the use of Starlink, other countries have resulted in other alternative infrastructure to ensure that internet connectivity is accessible in all parts of their countries, specifically, the rural areas. Alternatives that have been taken towards the Starlink network include the IRIS Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite) project launched by the European Union that will deploy 264 low-orbit satellites and 18 medium orbit satellites into space by the year of 2030. African countries on the other hand have resulted in investing their own internet service providers and improving on infrastructure such as underwater sea cables, cell towers, Fiber, etc. This promotes the idea of internet without dependency where local network providers have the space to develop and impact the countries that they operate within. Graham (2014) though, highlights that we must move beyond questions of access to ask: whose internet is it, and who benefits from its architecture?” (p. 116). The growth and operations of Starlink in other countries requires for regulation rules that countries can have control over, removing the ideas of hierarchal power in the digital space and promoting a postcolonial digital age. 
</P>

<P>
   The expansion of Starlink into countries like South Africa, India, Nigeria, South Africa and Ukraine demonstrates complexities that lie within the links between internet infrastructure, geopolitics, and digital coloniality. The idea behind satellite internet and connectivity is a great proposal to solve and bridge the gap between parts of the world that have access to the internet and parts of the world that do not have the infrastructure to ensure internet access but the risk lies in the fact that with this strategy there may be an encountering of inequalities based on power structures as there is a lack of control over the internet functionality from local network service providers. The internet is evolving into a space where power is shaped and established, and political structures are set in stone. Starlink serves as the beginning or a new digital standard but is an endangerment to the idea of digital freedom for all the countries that have enabled it.
