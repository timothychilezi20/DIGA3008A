          <h3>Reflection on the Implementation of the Website</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Interactive Media, Semester 1 has taught me the basics behind what it
          is to build a website and throughout the experience I have learned to
          understand that web development requires strong focus behind specific
          elements which will result in a fully fledged product. Throughout
          website development, I have gotten to understand the basics behind the
          concepts of strong design principles with the incorporation of User
          Interface and User Experience. This website required thorough thought
          and design consideration, making sure that I had to understand the
          importance of structure and navigation and consider the experience of
          the users when taking steps to achieving a complete website. This
          reflection will document the experience that I had making this website
          and explain the processes of implementing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a
          relevant API. My aim was to create an elegant yet simple experience
          where users would feel ease navigating through my website.
        </p>
      

        <div class="heading">
          <h3>Folder Structure</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          The beginning of my website served as a very challenging experience as
          I had to first understand what a folder structure truly is. I found
          out that the folder structure is essential towards the way that we
          link our files and yet, I did not understand how to implement a neat
          folder structure and hence this served as a challenge for the
          consistency of my website. My folder structure before this consisted
          of all my pages in folders, so I had a separate file for each part of
          my folder so, there was even, in reference to the feedback that I had
          received, html and JavaScript in a folder titled CSS. In simple terms,
          the folder structure was a mess. I therefore nested my folder
          structure according to each of the separate pages that I have for my
          website and therefore had a structure of, for example, Home-Page >
          HTML, CSS, Script, Images. Each of the designated pages on my website
          have this structure and anything related to the designated page, from
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript, each of these were placed in a specific
          folder. This accounted for a more consistent coding system where I was
          able to easily work with the folder structures and therefore the
          process of linking and calling pages and referencing images. The
          naming conventions of the files follow a consistent manner, using
          dash-case/kebab-case as the main naming convention for the files that
          I had. This was to keep in mind the fact that I wanted the process of
          working on my website easier and for anyone who navigates my website
          to further understand it.
        </p>
    
    
 <div class="heading">
          <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
           <P>
            The Semantic Markup of the website was a crucial component in forming the structure of my website and with these components, it was easier to section parts of the website. The semantic markup elements such as header, nav, section, and footer provided the structure required to build the website forward and with this semantic markup, there is more context provided about what each part of the website is about and the overall functionality behind it. The use of nav indicates the navigation menu container and with the container and navigation, it is easier to understand what each part of the website is about, and we therefore know that whatever is contained underneath the nav markup is allocated towards the navigation bar/menu. Elements such as the description section were wrapped in the section tags, so that it was easier to reference texts in paragraphs and place them in containers based on the information that each part of the website holds. The footer was meant to contain links for my social media links and copyright information and this serves as consistent location across all pages for any contact details/information for the user to find. There were div tags used to separate sections on my pages, but these were the smaller sections such as buttons and headings. 
        </P>
        </div>
       

<div class="heading">
    <h3>Metadata</h3>
    <P>
     The metadata that I included for the website was specific to giving the pages of my website a description of sorts and  title using the title and meta name=”description” tags. Then, included in the metadata is the tags meta charset=”UTF-8” and meta name=”viewport” and this is meant to support the rendering and responsiveness across different devices that the website is displayed on. The author names, also were important to implement as I only implemented that at a later stage of the website’s development and therefore, understood the functionality behind having author section in the metadata. I learned that this was to ensure that browsers and search engines fully understand and can interpret the content on the website. 
</P>
</div>

<div class="heading">
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <P>
        The Cascading Style Sheets play a very vital role in stylizing the HTML that you have set out on the website hence it is important to make sure that the HTML is structured correctly to ensure a near seamless and manageable process of styling your website. At first, I had all my CSS in designated files according to the website pages but the worst thing of all was that I specifically had CSS for all blog pages, from week 1 to 14, but then all of these pages were near the same. This was advised against completely and I had to make a main CSS folder to contain the code that was similar across all the blog and other pages on my website. A main CSS folder created consistency and ensured that my website maintained the same look and formatting regardless of what page you are on. Although I do feel like the responsiveness of my website could have been better, especially where there are parts that have one word on each line. Besides that, the hamburger menu works quite well on the phone even though there is overlapping of the x button on the hamburger menu UI. The use of media queries across the website pages and specifically, the main CSS, had at least a reasonable responsive scale that at least made the website responsive on the phone. 
    </P>
</div>

<div class="heading">
    <h3>
        JavaScript
    </h3>

    <P>
       The JavaScript used across my website plays a key role in creating an interactive and responsive user interface. The form overlay functionality is controlled using ARIA attributes and class toggling to manage accessibility and visual state. When the user clicks the form button, the overlay becomes visible (aria-hidden="false"), and when clicking outside the form or the close icon, the overlay closes smoothly. This demonstrates how JavaScript can enhance modal interactions, keeping the experience intuitive and keyboard accessible. The form submission process is handled using async/await and the Fetch API, avoiding full-page reloads while still sending data to the server securely. By disabling the submit button during the request, and providing user feedback (green for success, red for error), the script ensures a user-friendly experience with clear communication. Errors are gracefully handled, distinguishing between response errors and network issues, and resetting the form upon success. 
    </P>
</div>
      

      <section class="Essay">
        <p>
          Overall, this website reflects a thoughtful implementation of UI/UX
          principles, accessibility standards, and responsive development
          practices. It is not only a demonstration of technical growth, but
          also a foundation that can be built upon as future skills and design
          ideas evolve. Website creation is not just about making something look
          pretty, but it is about how we can use elements such as HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript to ensure that the website is functional and readable
          across all platforms.
